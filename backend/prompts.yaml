    Paper Title: {title}
    Abstract: {abstract}
    Sections: {sections}

    Research and provide:

    1. PREREQUISITES: What background knowledge does a reader need? Research each topic and suggest specific learning resources (videos, tutorials, papers).

    2. READING SEQUENCE: What order should sections be read for optimal understanding? Consider:
       - Which sections introduce key concepts needed later
       - Which sections can be skipped on first read
       - Dependencies between sections

    3. KEY CONCEPTS: For each section, what are the 2-3 most important concepts to understand?

    4. DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT: Rate overall difficulty and target audience.

    5. ESTIMATED TIME: How long to read thoroughly vs. skim.
